# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists
This project is about learning how to use linked lists in C. The requirements for the project are as follows:
 
- You must use the Betty style guide for your code.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- You are not allowed to use any functions from the C standard library other than malloc, free, and exit.
- You are allowed to use the function _putchar.
- You must include the prototypes of all your functions in the header file lists.h.
- You must include all your header files using include guards.
- The project includes a number of examples that you can use to test your code. However, you do not need to push the main.c files to your repository. We will use our own main.c files at compilation.

The project also includes a number of tests that you can use to verify that your code is working correctly. These tests are located in the tests directory.

### Learning Objectives
- The goals of this project are to:

- Learn how to use linked lists in C.
- Start to look for the right source of information without too much help.
- Understand the importance of plagiarism and copyright.
### Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
