This script will first get the C file name from the environment variable CFILE. Then, it will run the preprocessor on the C file using the gcc command. The -E flag tells gcc to only run the preprocessor, and the -P flag tells gcc to print the preprocessor output to standard output. The output of the preprocessor will be saved in the file c. Finally, the script will display the preprocessor output.
