###C - More Functions, More Nested Loops
This project is a collection of C programs that demonstrate
 the use of more functions and nested loops. It aims to provide solution of
tasks given at ALX-Software Engineering, the concepts in the C programming language
## Description
In this project, we will find a set of C programs that focus on more advanced usage
 of functions and nested loops. The programs cover various topics and problem-solving scenarios,
 allowing us to explore and practice different techniques.
