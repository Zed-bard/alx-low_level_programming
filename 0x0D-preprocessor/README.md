# C - Preprocessor
echo "--->" The C preprocessor is a part of the C programming language that is responsible for performing macro substitution and file inclusion during the preprocessing phase of compilation. It is a text processing tool that allows you to define macros, constants, and perform conditional compilation.

| Task                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Object-like Macro    | An object-like macro is a preprocessor directive that defines a constant value or expression. It is used to replace occurrences of a particular token with a specific value or expression throughout the code. |
| Pi                   | Similarly, it is possible to create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.                                                                         |
| File name            | To print the name of the file that the program was compiled from, followed by a new line, the predefined macro `__FILE__` can be used.                                                                     |
| Function-like Macro  | A function-like macro is a preprocessor directive that behaves like a function. It takes arguments and performs a specific operation or calculation.                                                      |
| SUM                  | A function-like macro can also be used to compute the sum of two numbers.                                                                                                                                  |
