# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This GitHub repository contains the solutions to seven tasks related to bit manipulation in the C programming language. Among these tasks, the most interesting one is **Crackme3**.

## Task 7: Crackme3
**Level: Advanced**

In this task, you are challenged to find the password for the program **crackme3** and save it in a file named **101-password**. The password should be exact with no extra spaces or new lines.

To run the program with the found password, use the following command:
```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x14. Binary$ ./crackme3 `cat 101-password`
```

If you successfully find the password, you will see the following message:
```bash
Congratulations!
julien@ubuntu:~/0x14. Binary$
```

## Repository Information
- GitHub repository: [alx-low_level_programming](https://github.com/Zed-bard/alx-low_level_programming)
- Directory: 0x14-bit_manipulation

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do, we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to`ALX Software Engineering` for providing this project as a second chance opportunity. After taking a **one-month** rest, I appreciate their support and the updated system information on my future development.
