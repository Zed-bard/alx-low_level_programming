# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

## Description
This C project focuses on understanding and implementing doubly linked lists. By completing the tasks outlined below, you'll gain knowledge about what doubly linked lists are, how to use them, and develop the ability to find information independently.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of a doubly linked list.
- Learn to manipulate doubly linked lists.
- Develop the skill to search for information effectively.

## Tasks

### 0. Print list
Write a function (`print_dlistint`) that prints all elements of a `dlistint_t` list. This task introduces you to basic traversal of a doubly linked list and printing its elements.

### 1. List length
Implement a function (`dlistint_len`) that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list. This task focuses on counting the elements in a doubly linked list.

### 2. Add node
Create a function (`add_dnodeint`) that adds a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list. You'll be manipulating the list structure by adding nodes at the head.

### 3. Add node at the end
Develop a function (`add_dnodeint_end`) to add a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list. This task extends your knowledge to appending nodes at the tail of the doubly linked list.

### 4. Free list
Write a function (`free_dlistint`) to free a `dlistint_t` list. Here, you'll implement the cleanup process to release allocated memory for the entire list.

### 5. Get node at index
Implement a function (`get_dnodeint_at_index`) that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list. This task involves navigating the list to find and return a specific node.

### 6. Sum list
Develop a function (`sum_dlistint`) to calculate and return the sum of all the data (n) in a `dlistint_t` linked list. You'll perform a basic arithmetic operation on the elements of the list.

### 7. Insert at index
Write a function (`insert_dnodeint_at_index`) to insert a new node at a given position in a `dlistint_t` list. This task challenges you to insert a node at a specified index, altering the list structure accordingly.

### 8. Delete at index
Create a function (`delete_dnodeint_at_index`) to delete the node at a specified index in a `dlistint_t` linked list. You'll learn to remove nodes from specific positions in the list.

### 9. Crackme4
Discover the password for `crackme4`. This task involves analyzing and understanding a password-protected program.

### 10. Palindromes
Explore palindromic numbers. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers (e.g., 9009 = 91 Ã— 99). This task involves mathematical exploration and problem-solving.

### 11. crackme5
Write a keygen for `crackme5`. Develop a key generator for a password-protected program (`crackme5`). This task requires a combination of reverse engineering and programming skills.
