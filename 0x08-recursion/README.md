# C - Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
In C, recursion can be used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller
subproblems of the same type.
# OVERVIEWS OF THE PROJECT
This project Done in first sprint second month first project in ALX-Software Engineering
## General Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
You are not allowed to use static variables

| 0. She locked away a secret,
 deep inside herself, something 
she once knew to be true... but
 chose to forget           	 |a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.                                                         |
|  1. Why is it so important to dream? 
Because, in my dreams we are together	             |a function that prints a string in reverse.          |
|2. Dreams feel real while we're in them.
 It's only when we wake up that we realize 
something was actually strange        |a function that returns the length of a string.                       |
| 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream
 a little bigger, darling           | a function that returns the factorial of a given number.                                                   |
| 4. Once an idea has taken hold of 
the brain it's almost impossible 
to eradicate            | a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y                                                |
| 5. Your subconscious is looking
 for the dreamer             | a function that returns the natural square root of a number.                                                                   |
|  6. Inception. Is it possible?	          | a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0   |
| 7. They say we only use a fraction of our
 brain's true potential. Now that's when
 we're awake. When we're asleep, 
we can do almost anything    | a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. |
| 8.Inception. Now, before you 
bother telling me it's impossible...,    | a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.         |
